A place to practice using GitHub!

How to practice? 

First, 'clone' this repository to the GitHub Desktop app.

Next, check the folder on your computer and see this file (and maybe others). You can edit any of these.

Start by making a branch. You can call it anything. Once you have made your branch, feel free to edit any file in the folder.

After you make an edit, check the GitHub Desktop app and you'll see that it sees the changes. When you are happy with your edits, add a description and click 'commit'.

You can 'commit' as many times as you want.
